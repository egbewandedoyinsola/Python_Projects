Kindly check out the data for the LA Crime Project here https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8/about_data
**Key skills I improved on while working on this project**
Importing Pandas and matplotlib.
Reading in a csv file.
Checking Nulls usin .isna().
Dropping columns that contain NaN.
Sorting columns within a dataframe.
**Key take aways**
Creating new columns within a dataframe such as year and month.
Creating different visuals using matplotlib.
Overall I was able to tell a story with the data presented such as figuring out the Top 3 crimes by Average Victim Age, a line chart of Crime over Time...
Thank you for taking a look at this project.
